title: CodeQL 2.25.3 adds Swift 6.3 support
---

CodeQL is the static analysis engine behind GitHub code scanning, which finds and remediates security issues in your code. We&rsquo;ve recently released CodeQL 2.25.3, which adds support for Swift 6.3, promotes five C/C++ queries to the default code scanning query suite, and includes various accuracy improvements across languages.
Language and framework support
Swift

CodeQL now supports analysis of apps built with Swift 6.3.

Python

The Python extractor now supports the new lazy import ... and lazy from ... import ... syntax defined in PEP-810, which is part of Python 3.15.

Java/Kotlin

The java/xxe and java/xxe-local queries now detect sinks in the Woodstox StAX library, including direct uses of com.ctc.wstx.stax.WstxInputFactory and org.codehaus.stax2.XMLInputFactory2.

C/C++

We&rsquo;ve added AllocationFunction models for aligned_alloc, std::aligned_alloc, and bsl::aligned_alloc.

Query changes
C/C++

We&rsquo;ve promoted five queries to high precision and added them to the default code scanning query suite:

cpp/comparison-with-wider-type (Comparison of narrow type with wide type in loop condition).
cpp/integer-multiplication-cast-to-long (Multiplication result converted to larger type).
cpp/suspicious-add-sizeof (Suspicious add with sizeof).
cpp/wrong-type-format-argument (Wrong type of arguments to formatting function).
cpp/implicit-function-declaration (Implicit function declaration). For build-mode: none databases, this query no longer produces results, since they were noisy and imprecise.



C#

We&rsquo;ve updated the cs/useless-tostring-call query to avoid false positives in calls to StringBuilder.AppendLine and in calls of the form base.ToString(), and we&rsquo;ve made the alert message more precise.

JavaScript/TypeScript

The js/missing-rate-limiting query now accounts for Fastify per-route rate limiting.

Python

The py/bind-socket-all-network-interfaces query now uses the global data-flow library, leading to better precision and more results. The query also recognizes wrappers of socket.socket in the eventlet and gevent libraries as socket binding operations.

GitHub Actions

We&rsquo;ve improved the alert messages and source locations for the actions/artifact-poisoning/critical and actions/artifact-poisoning/medium queries, making alerts easier to understand and aligning them with similar queries that report on potentially untrusted artifacts.
The actions/missing-workflow-permissions query no longer produces false positives on reusable workflows where all callers set permissions.
We&rsquo;ve removed false positive injection sink models for the context input of docker/build-push-action and the allowed-endpoints input of step-security/harden-runner.

For a full list of changes, please refer to the complete changelog for version 2.25.3. Every new version of CodeQL is automatically deployed to users of GitHub code scanning on github.com. The new functionality in CodeQL 2.25.3 will also be included in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) 3.22 release. If you use an older version of GHES, you can manually upgrade your CodeQL version.
