---

As announced in April 2026, GitHub is rolling out a new token format for GitHub App installation tokens. To help you validate your apps and workflows before the rollout reaches you, we&rsquo;re providing a temporary request header that lets you force either token format on demand.
What is the header?
Setting X-GitHub-Stateless-S2S-Token on a POST /app/installations/:installation_id/access_tokens request overrides the server-side rollout decision for that single request.



Header value
Effect




enabled
Returns a stateless (JWT-format) token, regardless of where you are in the rollout.


disabled
Returns a stateful (classic opaque) token, even if your integration is already included in the rollout.


(absent)
Normal rollout behavior (i.e., no override).



Any other value (true, false, 1, 0, etc.) is silently ignored and given the standard rollout behavior.
The header is supported on the POST /app/installations/:installation_id/access_tokens REST API.
How to use it
Before the rollout reaches your app, test proactively
Use enabled to request a stateless token on demand and validate that your application handles it correctly.
When creating an installation access token, send the X-GitHub-Stateless-S2S-Token: enabled request header to force the new token format in the response. For full endpoint details and request examples, see the REST API documentation for creating an installation access token for an app.
A stateless token is a ghs_-prefixed JWT. It is longer (~520 characters) and contains two dots. In contrast, a stateful token is a short opaque string with no dots.
Things to check in your app:

No hardcoded token length assumptions
Any regex used to validate an installation token is updated to handle additional underscores and the presencce of a JWT. Our recommended regex to match both new and current format tokens is ghs_[A-Za-z0-9\._]{36,}.
Database columns for token storage and header settings accept at least 520 characters
Any token introspection or validation code treats ghs_ tokens as opaque strings

During the rollout, temporarily opt out if you need more time
If the rollout reaches your app before you&rsquo;re ready, you can set the header with disabled to continue receiving stateful tokens while you update your application.
Verifying the token type
You can verify the token type by checking the number of dots after the ghs_ prefix: a stateless JWT-format token has two dots, while a stateful opaque token has no dots.
Scope

The header is temporary. At a future deprecation point, to be announced separately in the coming weeks, it will no longer be respected. At that point, all eligible apps will unconditionally receive stateless tokens. Remove the header from your production code once you have validated both token formats.
Existing app installation tokens continue to work until they expire.
This change applies to GitHub Enterprise Cloud and Data Residency environments. GitHub Enterprise Server isn&rsquo;t impacted by this change.
Upcoming rollouts will apply the new token format only to GitHub App installation server-to-server tokens, including Actions GITHUB_TOKEN.
We&rsquo;ll share more details in the coming weeks on planned format changes for user-to-server tokens used in Copilot code review flows.

How to prepare

Test with enabled: Call the endpoint with the opt-in header and verify your app accepts the new token format end-to-end.
Test with disabled: Confirm your app also works with the classic opaque format, so it degrades gracefully if stateless tokens are ever temporarily unavailable.
Remove the header: Once both paths are validated, remove the header. GitHub&rsquo;s rollout will then automatically manage the token format.
